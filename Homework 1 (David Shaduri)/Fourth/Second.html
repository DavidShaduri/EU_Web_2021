	<h2>Galactic Rotation Curves</h2>
		<p style="padding-right: 200px">The story begins with galaxy rotation curves, which were the original motivation for postulating dark matter in the first place. Given a point gravitational mass, it's pretty simple to calculate the velocity of something orbiting around it, depending only on how far away the object is orbiting and how much mass is in the central point. Stuff orbiting further out from a point mass will be orbiting at a lower velocity.</p>
	<h2>Large-scale Universe Structure</h2>
		<p style="padding-right: 200px">We can run simulations of what the large-scale structure of the universe would look like, starting from the conditions a few thousand years after the Big Bang. Just throw in different amounts of regular matter (hydrogen-helium gas mix), light, dark energy, and matter which doesn't interact with electromagnetism, introduce some overdensities and underdensities of the magnitude and spacing we see in the Cosmic Microwave Background, and run it with General Relativity (this is more tractable than giving galactic formation the full GR treatment). Then just compare against the observed large-scale structure of the universe, to rule out combinations of these components. We should get a match with the pattern of voids and filaments and their densities and spacing we observe in the universe.</p>
	<h2>Galactic Cluster Lensing</h2>
		<p style="padding-right: 200px"> One of Einstein's famous original predictions was of the magnitude of displacement of the image of a star from its usual position during a solar eclipse, due to gravitational lensing from the sun. GR passed with flying colors. So, another concievable test that you can carry out for dark matter (once you gain a Hubble Telescope to play around with) is to find a bunch of galaxy clusters which are big enough to have gravitational lensing effects, and see how much of a dent they make in the images of the background galaxies. If it indicates that there's 6x more matter than you see, then that's another test passed.</p>
	<h2>The Bullet Cluster</h2>
		<p style="padding-right: 200px">Pretty much, the Bullet cluster is a pair of galaxy clusters that rammed into each other. Stars are very widely spaced. If the Milky Way and Andromeda collided, there would only be about one stellar collision in the whole interaction, IIRC. So the stars should mostly just go through each other. If dark matter mostly doesn't interact with itself, the dark matter blobs should just go through each other.</p> <hr>
	<h2 style="text-align: center">The CMB Power Spectrum</h2>
		<p style="padding-right: 200px">the CMB power spectrum (particularly the second and third peaks) perfectly fits with ~5% of the universe's mass-energy being accounted for by matter, and ~26% of the universe's mass-energy being accounted for by dark matter, summing up to 31%.</p>
